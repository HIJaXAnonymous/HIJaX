To be added.



Before setting up our project we'd like to make sure you have some prerequisite installations and setups.

### Set up Prerequisites

#### Set up a cluster account (Optional)


UNC Charlotte provides a cluster for educational purposes, [*Mamba*] [https://urc.uncc.edu/educational-clusters/mamba-user-notes], and a reserch cluster, [*Copperhead*][https://urc.uncc.edu/faqs/copperhead-user-notes]. Request an account in the appropriate cluster using the links mentioned earlier.

To use the cluster in UNC Charlotte you need to have *Duo* set up on your mobile device & UNC Charlotte account. Follow this [guide]  to setup Duo. [https://spaces.uncc.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=35651686]

**Note:** Since training the model takes a long time we highly recommend using a computer cluster.


####  Python 3.0 +

If you are using the cluster run the following command to enable *Python 3.7 with CUDA*: `module load cuda/8.0 cudnn/6.0-cuda8 anaconda3/5.0.1-cuda8` - Thanks to UNCC's Cluster Support Team for the help :').

If you are not using the cluster, install Python 3.7 from [*Anaconda*] [https://www.anaconda.com/download/].
