## Setup Prerequisites

Before setting up our project we'd like to make sure you have some prerequisite installations and setups.

### Cluster Account


This step is optional. UNC Charlotte provides a cluster for educational purposes, [*Mamba*](https://urc.uncc.edu/educational-clusters/mamba-user-notes), and a research cluster, [*Copperhead*](https://urc.uncc.edu/faqs/copperhead-user-notes). Request an account in the appropriate cluster using the links mentioned earlier.

To use the cluster in UNC Charlotte you need to have *Duo* set up on your mobile device & UNC Charlotte account. Follow this [guide](https://spaces.uncc.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=35651686) to setup Duo.

**Note:** Since training the model takes a long time we highly recommend using a computer cluster.


### Python

If you are using the cluster run the following command to enable **Python 3.7 with CUDA**: `module load cuda/8.0 cudnn/6.0-cuda8 anaconda3/5.0.1-cuda8` - Thanks to the UNCC Cluster Support Team for the help :').

If you are not using the cluster, install **Python 3.7** from [*Anaconda*](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).


## UNCC Model Setup

### Step 1: 
### Step 1: Clone
Run the following command in terminal/command prompt ``git clone https://github.com/taisazero/iTzFine---English-to-Python.git``
