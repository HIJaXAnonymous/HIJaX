## Setup Prerequisites

Before setting up our project we'd like to make sure you have some prerequisite installations and setups.

### Cluster Account


This step is optional. UNC Charlotte provides a cluster for educational purposes, [*Mamba*](https://urc.uncc.edu/educational-clusters/mamba-user-notes), and a research cluster, [*Copperhead*](https://urc.uncc.edu/faqs/copperhead-user-notes). Request an account in the appropriate cluster using the links mentioned earlier.

To use the cluster in UNC Charlotte you need to have *Duo* set up on your mobile device & UNC Charlotte account. Follow this [guide](https://spaces.uncc.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=35651686) to setup Duo.

**Note:** Since training the model takes a long time we highly recommend using a computer cluster.


### Python

If you are using the cluster run the following command to enable **Python 3.7 with CUDA**: `module load cuda/8.0 cudnn/6.0-cuda8 anaconda3/5.0.1-cuda8` - Thanks to the UNCC Cluster Support Team for the help :').

If you are not using the cluster, install **Python 3.7** from [*Anaconda*](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).


## UNCC Model Setup on Linux
This section is written based on our setup experience on UNCC's *Copperhead* cluster which runs *Red Hat's Linux 7.5*.

### Step 1: Python Setup
 To access Python 3 with cuda run the following command ``module load cuda/8.0 cudnn/6.0-cuda8 anaconda3/5.0.1-cuda8``
 **Note:** You need to run the above command on the cluster every time you login because the default python version is 2.7.
 **Optional:** To make *Python 3.7 w/ CUDA* the default Python run the following command ``echo 'module load cuda/8.0 cudnn/6.0-cuda8 anaconda3/5.0.1-cuda8' >> ~/.bashrc``
 ### Step 2: Dependencies Setup
 * Install *Dynet* using the command ``pip install --user dynet``
 * Install [xnmt](https://github.com/neulab/xnmt) using the following commands:
   * ``wget https://github.com/neulab/xnmt/archive/0.1.0.tar.gz``
   * ``pip install --user 0.1.0.tar.gz``
   
   
 
 ### Step 3: UNCC's Model Setup
Run the following command in terminal/command prompt ``git clone https://github.com/taisazero/UNCC-CoNaLa.git``

### Step 4: Test Run
